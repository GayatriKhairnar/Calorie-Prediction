# Calorie-Prediction

The Calorie Calculator project stands as a robust tool crafted to precisely gauge calorie expenditure during physical activity. Created through the fusion of HTML, Flask, Python, an XGBoost algorithm, and Tailwind CSS, this tool provides an intuitive interface for users seeking accurate monitoring of their calorie burn.

By inputting diverse parameters, users enable the application to leverage the potent XGBoost algorithm, which then analyzes these inputs to produce tailored estimates of calorie expenditure, reflecting each user's individual physiological characteristics.
